# Network Sniffer

This is a simple network sniffer implemented in Python using the Scapy library. It listens for incoming packets on the network and displays information about them, such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol, source and destination ports, and payload size.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install scapy
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python network_sniffer.py
   ```

## Features

- Supports sniffing of TCP, UDP, and other IP packets.
- Displays information about source and destination IP addresses, protocol, source and destination ports, and payload size.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy library

## Example Output

```
Starting packet sniffer...
TCP  192.168.1.10:52134 -> 8.8.8.8:443  Payload size: 120 bytes
UDP  192.168.1.20:123 -> 192.168.1.1:123  Payload size: 48 bytes
IP  192.168.1.30 -> 192.168.1.1  Protocol: 1
```

## Notes

- Depending on your operating system and network configuration, you may need to run the script with elevated privileges (e.g., using `sudo` on Unix-like systems) to access raw sockets.
